# JPEG-and-LZW-Compression

Implemented the encoding and decoding techniques used by JPEG as well as LZW to compress images in real-time.  Performed Compression Ananlysis on both the methods by analyzing the outputs before and after compression, as well as comparison of both techniques and the loss of information which occurs during compression.
